In the process of adding a credit card for an internet purchase after choosing to pay with credit card the user has to put his credit card details, after that the billing address is checked.
If it is incorrect the process goes back to the user so that it can be modified, if it is correct the process continues.
Afterwards the user needs to click in the continue button to move forward.
The Credit Card is then verified by the Credit Card Authority.
The result is then checked and if it is validated the credit card is added, if not the addition is cancelled.
