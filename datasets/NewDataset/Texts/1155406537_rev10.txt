A client who wants to create a Paypal account first needs to determine the desired account type.
He should either select a personal account or a premium account.
Afterwards, the client should enter login details, such as e-mail address and desired password, personal details, such as name and date of birth, as well as his telephone number and address.
Finally, the client needs to declare if he has been affiliated with any politically exposed person.
When the client clicks the create account button, the details will be sent to the Paypal system.
When a request is received, the system will validate the input fields.
If there are any invalid fields, the client will be notified and needs to correct them.
Otherwise a welcome email will be generated and sent to indicate that an account has been created.
