Once the Mail Centre office of SSP receives an invoice from the client, it categorizes the invoice by staff member.
Then, the invoice is forwarded to the Administration Department; this Department processes the Invoice (a complex process) and then puts all the invoices into a collection box.
At 10 am every workday, the Data Entry office takes the invoices and enters all data in the SAP system, another complex process.
Every hour the Mail Centre office reviews the system and forwards all new invoices for validation; the Validation office executes the big process of validating invoices.
At the beginning of every week, the Payment office executes the payment of every validate invoice, this is another big process.
After the payment, all invoices are archived by the Registry office.
