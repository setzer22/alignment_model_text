A PayPal client wants to pay with bank account and has selected this as payment option.
For bank account addition, first, the PayPal client needs to enter all relevant bank details, i.e. first name, bank name, account type, BSB and account number, and click "continue".
This submits the bank details to the PayPal system.
After the bank details are submitted to the PayPal system, it makes two random deposits in the bank account.
The PayPal system sends a message with this information to the client bank account.
By this, the two deposits to the bank account are made.
Then, after 3-5 working days it notifies the PayPal client to check his bank account for received deposits.
The client may now log into his PayPal account, enter the amounts from the two deposits and click "verify".
The PayPal system then checks its values against the values entered by the client.
If the values match, the bank account is linked to the clients PayPal account and is considered as confirmed.
If the values do not match, the bank account is removed from the PayPal system, i.e. it could not be confirmed.
