The process starts with an informational meeting among the web design team.
If this meeting is not successful, the process ends here.
Otherwise, the team starts by creating a storyboard.
After an agreement on the storyboard, part of the team starts working on the design and development of the website.
Simultaneously, the team will start to prepare an initial draft of the content.
In case a review of the draft is needed, the marketing team will conduct this, before the web design team creates the final version of the content.
When the development and content have been completed, the website will be built and reviewed.
If the site is approved, the process is completed, otherwise the team goes back to the building step.
