This process describes how purchases work at the ACME Inc company.
A purchase is initiated by a demand identified within a department.
If there are enough goods in stock to satisfy this demand, then they are consumed locally and no further action is required.
Otherwise, the department defines which type of goods are needed and the necessary amounts and a purchase requisition is created in the ERP system.
This purchase requisition is processed by the Central procurement department.
First, the purchase requisition is checked on the ERP system to see whether the supplier information is available.
If this is a new supplier, first it has to be created within the ERP system.
Once it is created (or it if was already a known supplier), the purchase requisition is used to create an order template in the ERP system.
The final step in the process is the approval of this order, which is granted by another role, called "approver".
After receiving the new order template from the ERP system, he approves and triggers the purchase order.
