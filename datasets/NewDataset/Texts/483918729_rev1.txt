The process starts with the Provision Team receiving a request from a Customer.
First, the team has to identify the necessary parts.
If the team has any question about the request, they may ask for more information to the customer.
Afterwards, the team needs to check if all parts are available.
If available, they are supplied to the customer.
Otherwise, the team must record the petition, make an order to Daisuki, and contact the customer once the team collects all parts.
After the items are recollected by the customer, the final payment is received.
