In a certain company an Invoice process is started.
First the Vendor is tried to be located into the SAP system of the company.
If it is not possible to find it a sub-process to record this new Vendor is started.
The request for this new Vendor Record starts with the filling of the new Vendor Master Record form.
After this, the request is attached to the invoice and then putted in an internal outbox for new vendors.
Before the request is finished it is classified in urgent and non-urgent invoices.
Whenever the Invoice is urgent this Request has a maximum 24 hr window to be finished, while if it is non-urgent it has a 1-5 working days time to be done.
If the Vendor is already in the system or the request for new Vendor Record has finished, its SAP number is then added to the invoice and the process continues.
The invoices can be sorted in two ways: by amount and by vendor.
The invoices are then entered in the SAP system and the process is finished.
