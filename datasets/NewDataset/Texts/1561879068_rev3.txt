The process starts with a visitor filling out a registration-form.
The availability of products and the credit rating is checked first.
If the credit rating is higher than 9000 (according to Schufa) the registration is called unsuccessful.
If not the interim customer dataset record is created.
After this two sub-processes starts in parallel: Device provision and Register customer account at ISP nodes.
Once these sub-processes are finished a welcome package is created and sent to the customer to alert them that the registration process was completed successfully.
