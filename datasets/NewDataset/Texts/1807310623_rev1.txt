In ACME Inc. the process of purchase order-to-delivery is started by the financial department.
They check the purchase invoice and then sends it to the department.
The department checks the invoice for factual correctness and registers this in the SAPERION workflow system.
After this, a check is performed to see if the amount purchased is over $500 or under $500.
If it is over $500 the invoice is sent to the department head who then uses the SAPERION workflow to approve the invoice.
Once this has been done, or if the amount of the order is under $500 the ERP system is triggered for payment and the process ends.
