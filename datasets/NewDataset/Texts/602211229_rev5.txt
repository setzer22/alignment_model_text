The reimbursement process within the ERICS company is started as soon as a reimbursement request is received.
After receiving the request a reimbursement contact is created.
Afterwards a beneficiary is chosen.
Then, a refund period is contract duration is determined.
Once this has been completed a check is done to see if a customer is part of a "Verband" or only has normal subsidiaries.
In the former case, the customer group association is selected.
In the latter case, customers are selected manually.
Once either of these two activities have been completed a threshold is set.
Once the refund period has ended, a credit note is printed and sent to the customer.
In the meanwhile a reimbursement is calculated and paid to the customer.
Once the payment has been made and the notification to the customer has been sent, the process ends.
